            You have investigated the murder scene, spoken to the conductor, and searched for clues.

            - The victim was stabbed multiple times.
            - A strange note with symbols was found on the body.
            - Footprints outside the broken window suggest someone was here recently.
            - The conductor is nervous and seems to know something, but isn't revealing much.
